# decision-tree-id3
## An ID3-like decision-tree learner for classification in Python ##

* This is an implementation of an ID3 Machine Learning algorithm for binary classification for predicting heart disease, diabetes and to predict moves in a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Extended to include numeric and nominal attributes.
* Handles both numeric and nominal candidate features.
* The input should be in the form of ARFF files. http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/arff.html
* Usage : `dt-learn <train-set-file> <test-set-file> m`
  <br>Where m decides the extent of branching.
